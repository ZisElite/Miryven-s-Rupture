## Description

A 3D game inspired by **Melvor Idle** and **Runescape**. I loved the grinding that both games require, but Runescape lacks the idle aspect, while Melvor is purely idle, with frequent user input being necessery only at the very start. Melrune 3D is an attempt to combine aspects of both games, as well as introduce new elements to the exprience, so that it can be enjoyed by idle and active players alike.


## Roadmap overview

- v0.1: Create a simple ore field. The player can mine for any type of ore. There is no inventory, leveling mechanism, save or offline progress yet.
- v0.2: Add a simple inventory system and implement the save function \***New**\* along with a very basic UI \***end new**\*. There will be only one save for now.
- v0.3: Set up leveling mechanism, rare drops and mastery mechanism. 
- v0.4: Add more skills and implement offline progress. Maybe add dependencies between existing skills.
- v0.5: Add combat mechanics and a single enemy for testing.
- v0.6: Add more enemies with diffetent attack types. Implement a simple combat triangle.
- v0.7: Add the remaining basic skills and make any necessary adjustments to leveling.
- v0.8: Add Unique drops from enemies, pets and equipment slots.
- v0.9: Make any reworks on drop rates, leveling, prices, etc.
- v1.0: Set up a server and implement online authentication, cloud save and add more profile slots. 

### Detailed roadmap

#### v0.1, status: completed

A very simplistic scene, consisting only of a pickaxe and 8 ore nodes. The player can select a node with a mouse click and the pickacxe will start mining that node, slowly depleting the node's health. The minerals on the nodes  will gradually disappear as its health diminishes. After a node gets depleted, it will refill to full health after a set amount of time. The player gets nothing from mining the nodes, since there are no leveling mechanism or an inventory. The camera controls are complete and the player can fly around the scene, within specific bounds.
