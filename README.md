## Description

A game inspired by **Melvor Idle** and **Runescape**. I loved the grinding that both games require, but Runescape lacks the idle aspect, while Melvor is purely idle, with frequent user input being necessery only at the very start. Melrune is an attempt to combine aspects of both games, as well as introduce new elements to the exprience, so that it can be enjoyed by idle and active players alike.

## Game modes

### Idler mode
For the lovers of purely idle games, you don't have to do any active gameplay except from the start.

### Clicker mode
The exact opposite of idler mode, you have to click if you wanna progress.
**Important**: there will be a form of idling, but will be minimal and unlocked somewhere at mid game.

### Adventurer mode
Featuring an **open**-ish world and a **story**, you can combine idling and clicking to progress the way you like best.
